# ESP32-S3 N8R2 RGB (HW-678)

Professional embedded firmware project for controlling the onboard WS2812 addressable RGB LED

This repository follows strict embedded architecture, modular design, 
Git-controlled firmware versioning, and disciplined coding standards.

---

# 1. Project Objective

This project implements:

- Structured RGB LED driver
- Hardware abstraction layer (HAL)
- Clean configuration separation
- Git-based firmware version traceability
- Scalable embedded firmware architecture
- Strict comment and file documentation standards

The goal is not just LED control — but professional firmware engineering practice.

# 2. Current Status

**Firmware Version:** v0.4.0 (Development)  
**Current Phase:** Phase 4 – LED Engine Architecture  

Phase 4 introduces a dedicated LED engine task,
separating LED behavior from application logic
and stabilizing RTOS lifecycle handlin

See [`docs/firmware_roadmap.md`](docs/firmware_roadmap.md) for detailed roadmap.

# 3. Hardware Information

Board        : ESP32-S3 N8R2 (HW-678)
Flash        : 8MB
PSRAM        : 2MB
MCU          : ESP32-S3
USB          : Native USB
RGB LED      : WS2812 (Addressable RGB)
Data GPIO    : GPIO 48
Protocol     : 800kHz single-wire (RMT peripheral)

---

# 4. Development Environment

Framework    : ESP-IDF (FreeRTOS-based)  
Build System : PlatformIO  
IDE          : Visual Studio Code  
Environment  : esp32s3_hw678  

No manual ESP-IDF installation is required.  
PlatformIO manages the complete toolchain.

---

# 5. Firmware Versioning

Firmware version is automatically generated using:

```
git describe --tags --always --dirty
```

Behavior:

- If commit is tagged → Firmware shows tag (e.g., v0.1.0)
- If ahead of tag → Shows commits ahead + hash
- If uncommitted changes exist → Appends `-dirty`

Example:

```
v0.4.0-7-g91acbd2
```

This guarantees:

- Full build traceability
- Reproducible firmware
- Deployment debugging capability

`include/version.h` is auto-generated during build and NOT committed.

---

# 6. Project Architecture

This firmware follows layered embedded design:

- src/        → Application & module implementations
- include/    → Public header interfaces
- lib/        → Low-level reusable drivers (WS2812)
- test/       → Unit testing
- config.h    → Hardware configuration abstraction
- system_init → Centralized firmware initialization layer

Layered flow:

main.c  
   ↓  
system_init.c  
   ↓  
rgb.c  
   ↓  
ws2812.c  
   ↓  
ESP-IDF RMT driver  

Key Design Rule:

Application logic MUST NOT directly access hardware drivers.

All hardware interaction must flow through abstraction layers.

### Runtime Flow

main.c
 └── system_init()
 └── led_engine_init()
     └── rgb_init()
         └── ws2812_init()

LED control is fully owned by led_engine.
Application layer does not directly control hardware.

# 8. Coding Standards

## 8.1 Comment Rules

Allowed:
```
/* Multi-line comment */
```

Not allowed:
```
// comment
```

Single-line comments using `//` are reserved ONLY for temporarily disabling code.

---

## 8.2 Mandatory File Header

Every `.c` and `.h` file MUST begin with:

```
/============================================================
Project : ESP32-S3 N8R2 RGB (HW-678 Board)
Author  : Shantanu Kumar
GitHub  : https://github.com/shantanuk47

Date :
File :
Purpose :
============================================================/
```

Files without header are non-compliant.

# 9. Build & Flash Process

All operations can be performed using PlatformIO GUI 
or via CLI (recommended).

## 9.1 Clean Project

```
pio run -t clean
```

## 9.2 Build Firmware

```
pio run
```

## 9.3 Upload Firmware

```
pio run -t upload
```

## 9.4 Serial Monitor

```
pio device monitor
```

Default Baud Rate: 115200

# 10. Git Discipline

The following are NOT tracked:

- .pio/
- build/
- sdkconfig
- IDE configuration files
- Binary artifacts (.bin, .elf, .map)
- include/version.h (auto-generated)

Only source code and stable configuration are version-controlled.

Releases must be tagged before deployment.

---

# 11. Engineering Philosophy

This project enforces:

- Strict compiler warnings (-Wall -Wextra -Werror)
- No magic numbers
- No uncontrolled global variables
- Deterministic task behavior
- Clean driver abstraction
- Hardware portability

Embedded firmware must be predictable, testable, and maintainable.
